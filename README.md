# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Instructions on how to run the application locally.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
3. Use the git clone command followed by the URL of the GitHub repository. 
4. Use the cd command to change directories into the cloned repository
5. then run the command - npm install
6. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server, which allows you to view the      application in your web browser.
7. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5173/

Approach

1.  The first thing i decide was a rough form of the app layout abd fuction 

2.  The next step include finding out requirement or layout of the app

3.  Next step i form the dummy app with static data to get the formate currect 

4.  In the next step i call the  API to get the it call with the city name

        - the data then store in the useState variable in json formate so that it can be easly be acesss.

        - the city name also goes to the  state varaible then pass to the api url

5.  In the last step i work on the responsive side of the app
